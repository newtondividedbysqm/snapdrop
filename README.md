# A Non-Crypto-Scam-Fork of Snapdrop 

Snapdrop used to be be a well-known open source, peer2peer file sharing service, inspired by Apple's Airdrop that sent files ONLY through the local network. In beginning of 2025 the whole site was bought out by LimeWire which redirected all functionalities to LimeWire's CLOUD BASED service, hence all fles are being uploaded into the LimeWire Cloud, instead of staying on the local network.

This is a fork to preserve the state of the repository before the aquisition, i.e. for Self-Hositng  
The current sentiment seems to be in favor of switching over to [PairDrop](https://github.com/schlagmichdoch/PairDrop)
